## 🏁 Getting Started

### 3. GitHub and CI

- [ ] Create the `dev` and `prod` environments and the `SPA_ENV_FILE` secret. See [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables).

## 📝 Environment Variables

For first timer, you need to create the 2 environments in your github repo. First is `dev` environment, and second is `prod` environment (that's why in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` we stated `environment: dev`). In both environments, name it `SPA_ENV_FILE` (that's why in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` we stated `secrets.SPA_ENV_FILE`).

The value for `SPA_ENV_FILE` in `dev` environment is the content of `apps/spa/.env.local`, and the value for `SPA_ENV_FILE` in `prod` environment is the content of `apps/spa/.env.prod`. CI writes the secret to `apps/spa/.env.local`. If the secret is empty, CI copies `apps/spa/.env.example` to `apps/spa/.env.local`.

Source of truth is local env files. When changing them, update deployment/CI project env too.

<!-- For first timer, you need to create 2 environments in your github repo.
Go to your Github repo -> `Settings` tabs -> `Environments` -> `New environment` -> `dev` and `prod` (that's why in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` we stated `environment: dev` and `environment: prod`).

To push our local env variables to the github repo, run:

```bash
# that's why in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` we stated `secrets.SPA_ENV_FILE`
gh secret set SPA_ENV_FILE -e dev < ./apps/spa/.env.local
gh secret set SPA_ENV_FILE -e prod < ./apps/spa/.env.prod
```

Source of truth is local env files. When changing them, update deployment/CI project env too. -->
