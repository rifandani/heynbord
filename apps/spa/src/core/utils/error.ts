 *    but truthful, and strictly better than saying nothing;
 * 4. a generic message, for a `ZodError` (the server sent a shape we cannot
 *    read — naming the offending field leaks our internals) or for anything
 *    thrown that is not an `Error` at all.
 *
 * Takes `unknown` on purpose: `onError` and `query.error` carry a declared
 * union that nothing verifies at runtime, and callers that hand-rolled
 * `error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)` have no union at all.
