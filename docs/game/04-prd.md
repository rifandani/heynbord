## 1. Summary

Heynbord v1 is a single-player web game. It is a fantasy collectible card game with automatic lane battles and a countdown hand. The player plays a Campaign of 30 Stages and a tower of 50 Floors.

## 2. Problem and opportunity

- Fans of *Kings and Legends* and *Rise of Mythos* lost their game when it shut down in 2019 and when Flash stopped in 2020.
- The 2023 revival has mostly negative reviews because of pay-to-win monetization.
- No modern, fair browser game gives the countdown-hand lane battle experience.

## 3. Goals

| ID | Goal | Measure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | Give a complete single-player experience | A player can finish the Campaign in 8 to 15 hours. |
| G2 | Make battles easy to read | 8 of 10 playtesters can explain why they won or lost. |
| G3 | Be fair | No playtester names "pay-to-win" or "grind" as their main problem. |
| G4 | Run well on the web | 60 fps on a normal laptop. 30 fps or more on a mid-range phone in landscape. |
| G5 | Be ready for online play | The server in v2 can use the rules package with no change to the rules. |

## 4. Non-goals for v1

- Online play, accounts, PvP, guilds, chat, leaderboards
- A shop, payments or ads
- Trading between players
- Native mobile apps
- Portrait layout on phones
- Hybrids, awakening, more than 4 Races, more than 5 Ranks

## 7. Release criteria for v1.0

1. All **M** requirements are done.
2. A playtest group of 5 to 10 people finishes the Campaign without a blocking bug.
3. Goals G2, G3 and G4 pass in the playtest.
4. Balance simulations show archetype win rates of 45% to 55%.
5. All text is complete in `en-us` and `id-id`.
6. A trademark check of the name "Heynbord" and the draft names is done.
7. The art and audio licence record is complete.

## 8. Assumptions

- One developer works on the game part-time or full-time for about 6 months.
- AI tools can make art in a consistent style with a good workflow.
- The existing `apps/spa` stack (React, TanStack, Vite, PWA) is the base.
- Players accept a local save if export and import are available.

## 9. Risks

| Risk | Effect | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI art is not consistent | The game looks cheap | Use a strict style guide, reference sheets and a review checklist (see Art Direction). |
| The scope is too large for one person | Late release | Keep v1 small. Cut **C** and then **S** requirements first. Use the milestones in the Roadmap. |
| Balance is hard with 100 cards | Some Decks are too strong | Use headless simulations from the start. |
| 3D performance on phones | Low frame rate | Use performance budgets (see Technical Design). Test on a real phone from Milestone 1. |
| Legal claims about similarity to the original games | Forced changes | Use new names, art, text and numbers. Do not copy assets or card text. |
| AI tool licence changes | Art cannot be used | Keep the licence record. Use tools whose terms permit commercial use. |
| Loss of local save | Players stop | Export and import. Remind the player to export a backup after long sessions. |

## 10. Open questions

| No. | Question | Owner | Due |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Final names for Races, Ranks, currency, Regions and Heynspire | Game director | Milestone 3 |
| 2 | Which AI image tool and which audio sources | Art director | Milestone 1 |
| 3 | Domain name and hosting for the public release | Product owner | Milestone 4 |
