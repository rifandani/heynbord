# Network-boundary mocking with MSW

The unit tests covering the API layer faked HTTP by replacing imports (`vi.mock("ky")`, `vi.mock("@/core/services/http")`, hand-rolled `{ instance: { post } }` objects), so real ky never ran and a wrong prefix, dropped header, or bad path template could not fail a test. They now fake at the network boundary with `msw@2` (`setupServer`, Node only), which runs real ky, real URL construction, and real Zod parsing. This does **not** widen ADR-0001's scope: unit tests remain pure module logic under `environment: "node"` — no jsdom, no RTL, no browser mode, no `msw/browser`. Playwright mocking is unchanged (`apps/spa` keeps hitting the real API).

## Vocabulary

> **Network Boundary** — where a request leaves the process (`fetch`/`http`/`XHR`). MSW fakes here, so everything the module does to build and parse the request really executes.
>
> **Module Boundary** — where an import is replaced (`vi.mock`). Faking here skips everything the replaced module would have done.

**Rule of thumb: if the subject under test builds or parses an HTTP request, fake at the Network Boundary; otherwise fake at the Module Boundary.** Both idioms are legitimate; mixing them in one file is a smell.

## Scope

MSW applies to exactly one file — `apps/spa/src/core/apis/cdn.unit.test.ts`. That is the complete set: no other test in the suite touches the network.

> Changed on 2026-10-03 by [ADR-0007](./0007-effect-is-the-application-runtime.md): ky is replaced by Effect `HttpClient` (`FetchHttpClient`). See [Amendments](#amendments).

## Considered Options

- **Keep module-boundary mocks** — rejected; they cannot observe the request, which is most of what these modules do.
- **Fixtures from faker, shared with the `e2e/_helper.ts` builders** — rejected; unit failures must reproduce identically, and faker belongs where the point is "any valid user works". Fixtures stay as fixed literals.
- **Fixtures derived from the Zod schemas** — rejected, and actively harmful: these modules exist to run `schema.parse(response)`, so a fixture generated from that schema can never fail it and the most valuable assertion becomes vacuous. Instead each file now has a *schema-violating 200* case alongside 401/404/500.
- **`expect()` inside a resolver** — rejected as the documented anti-pattern. A throwing resolver becomes a failed response, so ky raises an `HTTPError` and the report shows a confusing 500 instead of the assertion. It also passes silently if the resolver never runs. **Use capture-then-assert**: stash the request/body in the resolver, assert in the test body after the `await`. Where the URL is the method's only input, the handler matching *is* the assertion — no request assertion needed.
- **A shared handler catalog, or handlers inside `apps/spa/src/core/mocks/`** — rejected; test-only code does not belong next to production modules. Root-level `vitest.msw.ts` matches the existing `vitest.{config,setup,env-mock}.ts` convention and sits beside the setup file that owns its lifecycle.
- **Re-exporting `http`/`HttpResponse` through `vitest.msw.ts`** — rejected; handlers should look like textbook MSW so every upstream example applies. Test files import `msw` directly (root-hoisted devDependency, exactly as `vitest` already is).
- **A global server in `vitest.setup.ts`** — rejected on measurement, see below.

## Lifecycle: scoped, not global

`server.listen()` lives in `vitest.msw-setup.ts`, added to `setupFiles` for the spa project. The old `core` project is gone; these three files now live in the app. A single `setupServer` instance is shared process-wide, which matters because the root config runs `pool: "threads"` with `isolate: false`: files in a worker share globals, and two interceptor instances would contend for the same patched `fetch`/`http`/`XHR`.

The global alternative was preferred on design grounds — it would make "no unit test ever reaches the network" an invariant for all 55 files — but it was measured first and the cost decided it. Warm runs, 55 files:

| Config | Files with interceptors | Warm duration | Cumulative setup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Before MSW | 0 | 3.07s | 858ms |
| Global (`vitest.setup.ts`) | 55 | 3.72–4.33s (**+21–40%**) | 7.3–8.5s |
| **Scoped (core)** | 22 | 3.05–3.28s (**+3%**) | 2.5–3.2s |

Interceptor install costs ~140ms per *file*, so the bill scales with files touched, not tests. Paying +21–40% to guard 33 files that make no requests at all was poor value; ADR-0001's coverage amendment accepted +29% for something every file benefits from.

`onUnhandledRequest: "error"` (not `"warn"`) — verified by probe: an undeclared request hard-fails with `[MSW] Error: intercepted a request without a matching request handler`. Nothing in the suite trips it, because every OTLP exporter is already `vi.mock`ed.

**Consequence:** the guardrail covers `core`, not `spa`. Extending it is one line in that project's `setupFiles`, and any spa test that needs the network must add it.

## Consequences

- **`auth.ts`'s `afterResponse` hook was deleted.** It set `Authorization` on `request.headers` *after* the response returned, only on status 200 — and ky (verified in `2.0.2`, `distribution/core/Ky.js:623`) passes `response.clone()` and never retries a 200, so nothing read the mutated request. It was a no-op. The old test could only "pass" by pulling the hook out of `post.mock.calls[0]` and invoking it by hand; two of four tests existed to do that, asserting the body *ran* rather than that it *did* anything. Under MSW the effect is unobservable, which is how the dead code surfaced. Coverage branches went 99.51% → **100%** as a result; the whole suite is now 100/100/100/100 against the `perFile: 90` floor.
- **`@test/msw` is aliased twice** — in `apps/spa/vitest.config.ts` (`resolve.alias`) and `apps/spa/tsconfig.json` (`paths`).
- **ky retries GET twice by default** on 408/413/429/500/502/503/504, so the cdn 500 case passes `retry: 0` to avoid ~0.9s of backoff. POST is not retried by default, so the auth 500 cases need nothing.
- **fallow:** `vitest.msw-setup.ts` needs `unused-files: "off"` in `.fallowrc.json`, since `setupFiles` loads it by path and no import edge reaches it. Separately, `fallow dead-code` reports `msw` under "dev dependencies used in production" because it counts `*.unit.test.ts` under `src/` as production; every `msw` import site is a test file or `vitest.msw.ts`, it must stay a devDependency, and the finding is not suppressible via rule severity (the same limitation already noted for `fallow security`). Both `check:dead-code` and `check:audit` exit 0, so it is informational.

## Amendments

**2026-09-11 — the set is the three core files.** `apps/spa/src/core/services/http.unit.test.ts` now fakes at the Network Boundary, and the test of the second auth module was deleted with the module it covered (see below). The list under [Scope](#scope) shows the current set.

The scope rule is unchanged; the file moved across it. `Http` used to be a constructor call that built no request of its own — it handed a configured ky instance to the `apis/` modules and they did the building, which is why its test asserted object identity (`expect(http.instance).not.toBe(before)`) and sent nothing. It now attaches the Access Token in a `beforeRequest` hook and ends the Session on a 401 in `afterResponse`, so it builds and inspects requests, and **the rule of thumb selects it**: fake at the Network Boundary, because everything the module does to the request really executes.

That is not a stylistic preference here. The [Consequences](#consequences) section above records an `afterResponse` hook in `auth.ts` that set `Authorization` *after* the response returned and was therefore a no-op — a bug that survived because the old test pulled the hook out of `post.mock.calls[0]` and invoked it by hand, asserting the body ran rather than that it did anything. A Module Boundary test of the new hooks could fail in exactly the same way. Under MSW, "the header arrives" and "the header does not arrive" are observations about a real request, and a hook wired at the wrong point cannot pass.

`updateConfig` and `resetConfig` were deleted in the same change. With the Access Token read per request via `getToken`, nothing needs to mutate a live instance, and their only callers in the repo were the two identity assertions above.

**2026-09-11 — the second auth module in `apis/` deleted.** A second auth scheme — cookie/session, its own `authKeys`/`authRepositories` — with zero importers since `@workspace/web` was removed. It was allowlisted for coverage and carried an MSW test, so it contributed measured, tested, unreachable surface: every future reader of `apis/` had to work out which of two schemes the apps actually use. Recoverable from git if that migration happens, at which point it would be rewritten against whatever the backend then exposes.

**2026-10-02 — authentication removed.** The auth module, `apis/auth.ts`, the login route, and the Access Token hooks on `Http` are gone. `auth.unit.test.ts` is gone with them. `Http` is a ky constructor again, so `http.unit.test.ts` no longer builds a request and no longer uses MSW. The list under [Scope](#scope) is the current set.

## Amendments

**2026-10-03 — Effect `HttpClient` replaces ky.** `FetchHttpClient` calls `fetch`, so MSW intercepts it with no change to the lifecycle above. The rule of thumb stays. The Network Boundary files are now `core/http/api-error.unit.test.ts`, `features/cdn/cdn.service.unit.test.ts` and `features/cdn/cdn.atoms.unit.test.ts`.

One case in `api-error.unit.test.ts` is at the Module Boundary on purpose: an error body that breaks while it is read. MSW buffers bodies, so that failure never reaches the client through it. The test builds the response with `HttpClientResponse.fromWeb(...)` instead. It builds no request, so the rule of thumb agrees.

A server function is not an HTTP request that a unit test can see: TanStack Start compiles it into an RPC. `features/i18n/locale.atoms.unit.test.ts` replaces the `*.functions.ts` module at the Module Boundary. The wire format itself is tested without a network in `core/runtime/server-fn.unit.test.ts`.
